To ensure an intact lens structure, homeostasis within the lens cells is indispensable. Alterations of the lens structure result in opacity and lead to cataract. Renal glucosuria is defined by elevated glucose level in the urine without hyperglycemia and without evidence of morphological renal anomalies. In a Swiss family with autosomal dominant juvenile cataract, microcornea, and renal glucosuria, we have identified a nonsense mutation in a member of the carboxylic acid transporter family SLC16. The underlying gene defect in SLC16A12 resides within a 3 cM region on chromosome 10q23.13 defined by linkage mapping of this phenotype. We found tissue-specific variability of SLC16A12 transcript levels in control samples, with high expression in the eye and kidney, the two organs affected by this syndrome. This report demonstrates biological relevance of this solute carrier.

This vertical composition fluctuation due to the phase separation tendency is in contrast to the (0 0 1) case, where the fluctuations proceed in the lateral direction. The specific character of the phase instabilities is discussed with respect to the spinodal decomposition of the (Ga,In)(N,As) alloy grown by step-flow on the misoriented (1 1 1)B substrates.

Specifically, the lasso is a shrinkage and selection method for linear regression. We present an algorithm that embeds lasso in an iterative procedure that alternatively computes weights and performs lasso-wise regression. The algorithm is tested on three synthetic scenarios and two real data sets.

This combination produces a system that achieves very good results under a wide variety of conditions. Tested on several maize videos taken of different fields and during different years, the system successfully detects an average of 95% of weeds and 80% of crops under different illumination, soil humidity and weed/crop growth conditions. Moreover, the system has been shown to produce acceptable results even under very difficult conditions, such as in the presence of dramatic sowing errors or abrupt camera movements.

Among the different possibilities existing in the literature, it is very clear that models developed along the lines of continuum damage mechanics are more consistent with the definition of damage as a phenomenon with mechanical consequences because they include explicitly the coupling between damage and mechanical behavior. On the other hand, for seismic processes, phenomena such as low cycle fatigue may have a pronounced effect on the overall behavior of the frames and, therefore, its consideration turns out to be very important. However, most of existing models evaluate the damage only as a function of the maximum amplitude of cyclic deformation without considering the number of cycles.
